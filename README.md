# COMP5318-Machine-Learning-and-Data-Mining
This repository contains two machine learning projects completed for COMP5318 at the University of Sydney, Semester 1, 2025.
	•	Project 1: Classification of rice varieties using classical ML algorithms with data preprocessing, model evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning.
	•	Project 2: Image classification on the PathMNIST dataset using traditional ML, MLP, and CNN models with Keras and scikit-learn. Includes full ML pipeline: exploration, preprocessing, training, tuning, and evaluation.
